# SOLID Principles

## Overview

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## The Five Principles

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
**Better Maintainability**

A class should have only one reason to change.

---

### O - Open-Closed Principle
**Easy to Add Features**

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

[Read Details](2.O/Open%20Close.md)

---

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
**Safe Substitutions**

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking the application.

[Read Details](3.L/Liskov%20Substitution.md)

---

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
**Focused, Modular Interfaces**

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

[Read Details](4.I/Interface%20Segregation.md)

---

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
**Decoupled Design**

Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Key Concept | Main Benefit |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **SRP** | One responsibility per class | Better maintainability |
| **OCP** | Extend, don't modify | Easy to add features |
| **LSP** | Proper substitution | Safe polymorphism |
| **ISP** | Small, focused interfaces | Modular dependencies |
| **DIP** | Depend on abstractions | Decoupled components |
